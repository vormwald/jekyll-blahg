Welcome to this blog template by [cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co)! (Ported to Jekyll by [Mike Vormwald](https://github.com/vormwald))

Itâ€™s using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [jekyll-tailwindcss](https://github.com/vormwald/jekyll-tailwindcss) plugin. No `node_modules/` folder required ðŸ¥³. You can clone it on GitHub to use it for yourself, and see how it works!

The tags at the bottom of the page are dynamically generated. The more tags you use, the more tags are added to the list! Posts are simple markdown files.

You should also check out Cassidy's [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), her word game [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com), or her [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cassidoo).

Enjoy!
